# Free and Open-Source Funnel Plots for PowerBI

This repository contains a free PowerBI custom visual for you to create funnel plots. The visual is implemented purely within PowerBI and has no dependencies on external programs like R or Python. The visual natively supports tooltips as well as cross-plot filtering and highlighting.

The visual also provides an additive adjustment for overdispersion, as discussed in:
